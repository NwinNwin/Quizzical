### Challenges:
I challenged myself to build a whole quiz logic inside **1** component (src/components/Quiz.jsx). 
Inside the file "Quiz.jsx", you will find:
- API calls (axios)
- function that generate non-repeated number
- algorithm that check which choice is clicked & if it is a correct answer.

### What I learned:
I got to practiced with React Hooks (useState & useEffect), JavaScript array methods(map, forEach, etc...), and how to write more with less lines of code. For example, in **setCurrentQuiz** function, I convert an object from OpenTriviaDB API with keys of "correct_answers (str)" and "incorrect_answers ([str])" into 1 array ([str]).
